										<h1>The VR Headset</h1>
									</header>
                  <h2>A. Overview</h2>
                  <p>The most important aspect of our project - Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that uses computer systems to generate digital environments capable of simulating real-life images, sound and other sensory stimuli, allowing for users to immerse, visualize and interact with objects and other people in the virtual world. Due to its effectiveness in improving the effectiveness and productivity of our jobs, VR has been widely implemented in many industries such as education, healthcare, military, tourism, entertainment and military. As a result, our project aspires to capitalize on the applicability of Virtual Reality technology by developing a VR system featuring an immersive digital environment with numerous applications that would meet the user's demands, whether it’s for work or recreation. Furthermore, our system would enhance the experience by visualizing objects and user avatars in the environment with realistic 3D graphics which will allow for more interactivity between the user and the virtual world, enabling people to see animals and scenery that they couldn’t see up close before or interact directly with their friends in the digital world without the constraints of geographical distance and a digital screen.</p>
                  <h2>B. Motivation</h2>
                  <p>The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has created significant social and economic disruptions globally, resulting in millions of lives lost and exposing the fragileness of our major infrastructures such as healthcare, food and transportation [11]. In addition, the restrictions enforced on the populace by governments around the world to prevent the spread of the virus also meant that most of us have been forced to work and study from home over the past few months. While this would reduce the risk of infection in populated areas, it is also troublesome for many people as well because the productivity is not as high when you’re working remotely without direct access to your workspace and face-to-face communication with your co-workers. For those reasons, we have been inspired to create a Virtual Reality headset system that would help people solve problems of remote work. By using VR, users can stay at home but still be able to work, do training and better visualize their products in a 3D rendered virtual workspace, making it a more immersive experience and give users new perspectives that would not be possible when looking at a computer screen [12]. Therefore, we hope that by implementing a VR system into their jobs, people can work more efficiently and productively while also be able to collaborate and communicate with each other in a more dynamic, cost effective virtual environment.</p>
                  <h2>C. Description</h2>
                  <h3>C.1 The Outline</h3>
                  <p>In order to describe our Virtual Reality system, we ought to demonstrate the environment from which users will be interacting with. When users first put on our VR headset, they will be greeted by a virtual assistant who will appear to inform them about the terms and conditions along with disclaimers that people will need to know before using our product. Following that, a log in screen will pop up in front of the user’s face for inputting credentials which will then be checked and validated automatically using AI systems. Afterwards, the user will be transported to the main hub where the first thing they’ll need to do is create an avatar to represent them in the virtual world and choose the control settings that would suit their preferences most. Once that process is completed, everyone is free to explore the surrounding area. The environment of the world will be designed as a small town with applications acting as real functional buildings such as hospitals, libraries, malls, and stadiums. Those places would be staffed with AI bots and avatars of real-life staff of these establishments to assist the user with their needs. However, these integrations are not possible if the user doesn’t have the necessary equipment and components. Therefore, we have created a list of things required for our VR system to work which will include the head-mounted display, motion sensors, voice recognition system, eye-tracking system, and input devices [13]. Though we still have countless elements to improve on our project, those things mentioned above are the most important items that our system should have. To be more in detail, the headgear consists of many sensors that connect with users’ heads and collect data and read them. Accelerometers, magnetometers, gyroscopes, etc. [14] are also very crucial as we need to adjust the virtual vision of users so that they can play comfortably and avoid headaches, stun, ...
	Furthermore, like other headsets at the moment, input devices can be handheld controllers which will help the players to interact with most of the functions effectively. Besides all the main things, there are many optional types of equipment that we can add in. For example, for those who have backache while standing for a long time, we can make an ergonomic chair to help. Eyes diseases can be a big problem because glass will block space if we want to wear a headset and make it uncomfortable. So, we will ask the buyer for the required information first and then make suitable lens for them.
</p>
                  <h3>C.2 Applications</h3>
                  <p>Applications of our VR headset will be the highlight of our project. Firstly, our VR headset can be used as a simulator for training, especially in dangerous fields such as firefighting, security and medical. The lack of these real-life environments from the past led to the missing of important practice for everyone studying this. So, VR headsets can use be a possible solution to increase the availability and reduce the costs for workers needing training. Secondly, in the medical field, there can be a lot of healthcare personnel and medical students who need to have some experience in real practices before they can start working. Therefore, we cannot avoid the situation that there will be a lack human body models for practicing. With the headsets equipped for universities and schools, we can teach students deeper about human anatomy and medicine without needing to use real human bodies. For example, when we research real-life models, it is easy for us to miss a cell or a neuron because all of them are tiny. But with technology, we can add a zoom function to make this more comfortable. Lastly, the designers can use this headset to help visualize their concepts and ideas. When working on a PC, it is hard for a designer to draw 3D models exactly the way they want so they will have to continuously rotate the screen and make multiple edits. But with the headset, they can move around their project prototypes, view it in a better perspective, resolution and interact with it directly to test the functionality.</p>
                  <h2>D. Tools and Technologies</h2>
                  <h3>D.1 Hardware</h3>
                  <h4>Lenses</h4>
                  <p>The lenses of a VR headset are considered to be the most important part of the entire hardware component list. Lenses play a significant role. Without them, it is impossible for users to see the screen clearly because it is placed within extremely closed proximity of the eyes of the user, usually at around 3 to 6 centimeters, well below the minimum distance that the eye can focus. The main function of the lenses is to bend the incoming light in such a way that would enable the eyes to focus, which makes it seems light the light source (the screen) is further away from the eyes. </p>

                  <h4>Display</h4>
                  <p>Display:
	Currently, the most commonly used display technologies for VR headsets are LCD, OLED, and retinal projection [16]. For the most basic requirement, the display needs to have a high pixel density, as they are magnified through the lenses. Moreover, this will ensure that the images displayed will have a high degree of sharpness, giving the user a more pleasant experience while using the device
.</p>
                  <h4>Gyroscope</h4>
                  <p>A gyroscope is a device that utilizes the effects of gravity to determine the orientation of the targeted device that it is sending the information to. Specifically, a gyroscope can help determine how fast the device is rotating in all three X, Y and Z axis. This is important as it is the deciding factor to give timely visual updates to the display when the user moves their head in space. </p>
                  <h4>Hanheld controllers</h4>
                  <p>In order for users to interact with the system, handheld controllers are needed. While being used, these controllers are constantly being moved around in space. Currently, the two most common methods of tracking the controller positions relative to the headset are lighthouse tracking and inside-out tracking [17]. We will opt for the inside-out tracking method as it is cheaper and does not require any additional equipment. </p>
                  <h4>Speaker and microphone</h4>
                  <p>The headset we are aiming to develop has the ability to record sound and produce sound. So it is important that it is equipped with speakers and microphone in order to perform these tasks. Speakers need to be positioned in a way that maximizes comfort and at the same time make it easy for users to listen to. </p>
                  <h3>D.2 Software</h3>
                  <p>The most important pieces of software for VR development are those that have the abilities to create and generate realistic representations of the world, or to give developers a degree of freedom to create their own imaginary worlds. The most popular ones are Unity, Amazon Sumerian, Unreal Engine, CRYENGINE, Maya etc. Each of these software has their own strengths and advantages. Being sufficient in any of the VR focused software is a crucial skill to have in order to make this project a reality. </p>
                  <h2>E. Skill Required</h2>
                  <p>There are many skills required in this project. To begin with, decent knowledge and thinking in programming languages is a prerequisite, especially in C# and C++ since we will use Unity 3D or Unreal Engine to develop the virtual environment and the AI automatic systems. The second requirement in skills is designing sounds. Sound integration in VR experiences, such as background music, audio location, and sound effects is critical for creating immersive experiences for users. Another mentionable point is to have a good foundation in User Interface (UI)/User Experience (UX). They are crucial to this project because of the importance of the customer’s needs and experience, whether they feel comfortable, intuitive and satisfied or not during the interaction with the virtual world. Last but not least, we all should be able to perform effective teamworking and communication in order to create a shared purpose among team members that will allow us to achieve our objectives or solving problems together, increase the efficiency of the general work.</p>
                  <h2>F. Outcome</h2>
                  <p>As mentioned above, our purpose for this VR headset is to create practical and beneficial values for the current society. The headset involves an immersive digital world, which could make it easier for everyone to connect to each other, as well as help people to solve any problems remotely. For example, with jobs like firefighter, surgery, or police, which requires abundant real-life experience, the headset can simulate practical situations for workers to practice with, helping them improve their skills. Moving on to the cost for the VR headset, it would be slightly higher than expected, however, for the sake of wide distribution among society, we will do our best to reduce the price to make it affordable for most people. We’re really looking forward to the day when our products are popular in people’s lives, as the headsets would carry out values around the world, to the people who need them. </p>
