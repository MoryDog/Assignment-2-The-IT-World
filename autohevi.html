                  <h2>1. Autonomus Vehicles – a new form of transportation</h2>
                  <h3>1.1 The current situation of self driving vehicles</h3>
									<p>Autonomous Vehicles or AV in short, are receiving a substantial amount of development within the recent years. Many experts have predicted the rise of AV in the future [6]. They are vehicles that possess the ability to operate itself, based on the condition of the surrounding environment without any amount of human interaction. In order to perform such an advanced task, AV need an effective way of collecting and capturing data of the surrounding environment. Along with that, they need an adequete controlling program to handle collected data in order to make the correct controlling decisions.
	There is a variety of methods that enables AV to gather necessary data, each with their own strenghths and weaknesses, and used for different purposes. These data can be generally called sensory input. Sensory input can be reccorded in many ways, from many different perspectives and positions. The most common approaches to collect these data are: radar, sonar, camera, and LiDar. These sensors and devices work dependantly or independantly to provide information which is used to determine whether there are any obsticles in close proximity of the vehicle, whether the vehicle is following a correct direction or path, and define the meaning of traffic signals and traffic signs.
	The most vivid implementation of AV that customers can actually use is the service that a company named Waymo are providing. They have deployed a robo-taxi service in California, with a fleet of 100 self-driving minivans [7]. As the technological and engieering field tend to have standards for virtually everything, The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has defined a standard for different levels of automated driving. This is a six-level scale, ranging from level 0 to 5, with 0 meaning no automation and 5 meaning full automation [8].
</p>
                  <h3>1.2 What Autonomous Vehicles are capalble of doing now</h3>
                  <p>As AV are still during their intesnive development stage, a lot need to be done at the moment, especially from the technical standpoint. The first major thing that need to be done is developing more effective, and especially more accurate sensors or any form of data collecting and data capturing, as this is extremely vital for the safety of passengers riding on these autonomous vehicles. There has been cases that a AV failed to correctly handle a situation, with the most infamous case being the situation that a Tesla vehicle crashed into an overturned trucked in the state of California, USA [9]. Many problems are ultimately boilded down to the fact that a controlling unit failed to exactly determine the obsticle that is facing the vehicle. Problems relating to the conditions of the road, weather and traffic also require an intensive attention in order to increase the reliability of AVs.  </p>
                  <h3>1.3 The possible changes that can appear in the future</h3>
                  <p>In the future, developers can work out solutions for the remaining challenges that AVs will face in the practical condition. One of which is the interaction with passengers or riders. Traditionally, in a human operated vehicle, espeacially cars, drivers can make customized changes in the way he or she controls the vehicle based on their personal preferences or even emotions and physical conditions. This could be instances where a driver can decide to drive in a more calm manner to make the ride more relaxing and enjoyable, or drive a bit faster but still within the speed limit in order to save some time. As mentioned, not only drivers but passengers can also request the driver to drive or stop a certain way to match their preferences. In the future, AVs need to be able to handle this. Futhermore, developers and manufacturers can create an inter-connected network of AVs which allows them quickly communicate with eachother, thereby enabling better traffic related decisions to be made in order to improve travelling time by reducing chances of congestions. </p>
                  <h2>2. The likely impacts of Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
                  <h3>2.1 The main benefits that AV technologies brings to the world</h3>
                  <p>The development and implementation of AVs can have many impatcs, both positive and negative. With AVs being widely used, traffic and traveling as a whole will become more efficient and safer. Some of these benefits are:
<p>a. Reduced traffic accidents: As AVs are fully equiped with sensors which allow them to autonomously detect and predict collision, active safety systems like emergency breaking will defenitely help reduce the chances of accidents.</p>
<p>b. Reduced congestion: Once AVs can communicate with eachother, coupled with the network of AVs which can be used to measure real-time traffic information e.g vehicle density at a given location, AVs can find the most efficient route which will ensure the least amount of stopping possible.</p>
<p>c. Health and environmental benefits [10]: As AVs have high efficiency, polution and emision will be kept at a minimal level, thus, the environment and the health of the population will be least likely to be affected.
</p>
                  <h3>2.2 Traditional transportation methods can be replaced. Moreover, some workers may also be affected by this change.</h3>
                  <p>In contrast, the first noticable negative impact that the development of AV leaves is the reduction of professional drivers, people who drive vehicles like taxi and transporting vans for a living. Currently, the closest to AV that passengers and riders have is a human driver. Ultimately, AV are aimed to be as good as are better than a human driver by imitating how a human control a vehicle. At the basic level, human drivers also control a vehicle with their hands and feet based on the what they see through their eyes, what they hear through their ears and what they feel in terms of road conditions. With the introduction of AV, many human drivers will become reduncdant, as AV will become more cost-effective, furthur more, AV can have a much longer working shift compared to human drivers.
•	AV can change the way how I commute in the future
o	I am still too young to own a AV, but its benefits cannot be denied
	Should autonomous vehicles be fully developed and implemented, my daily life will defenitely be positively affected. Personally, I do not prefer taking long comutes. Because I think that spending time driving or riding on the road is a significant waste of time. The first use case for AV that I personally prefer is the ability to allow riders and passengers to freely perform other activities while staying within the vechicle, rather than focusing on the road and driving. With that amount of time saved, I can use it to do other, more important tasks such as replying emails, finishing my work, or even simply enjoying entertainment products like movies and music. All I all, I strongly beleive the development and introduction of AV will greatly improve my life in positive ways, mainly because it will help me to be more productive.

                  <h3>3.2 The people around me will experience the same changes</h3>
                  <p>I believe that my family members and friends will find the experience of AV to be similar to mine. One thing in particular is that roadtrips with my family and friends will be much more enjoyable because everyone can participate in leisure activities and not focuse on driving.</p>
