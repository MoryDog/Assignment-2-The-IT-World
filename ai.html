                  <h2>1. Capacity of AI and Machine Learning</h2>
                  <h3>1.1 The current standing of AI and Machine Learning</h3>
									<p>In this ever-changing world, technology has become something indispensable to our daily routine. They are present in every aspect of life, from doing house chores, learning at school to controlling Big Data, exploring space, and manipulating important chemical reactions. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are some of the main platforms for those innovations and developments. Until this moment, AI and Machine Learning have had a remarkable position in the IT industry. The appearance of the robot Sophia or many virtual assistants is the clearest proof of the power of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the moment. There is no doubt about the current position of AI and Machine Learning, Helbert Simon once said that “Machines will be capable, within twenty years of doing any work that a man can do “ [1].</p>
                  <h3>1.2 Possible things that AI and Machine Learning can do</h3>
                  <p>Nowadays, we can easily see trails of AI and advanced Machine Learning around us. For example, in our daily life such as “Smart House”, where everything can be controlled by voice and there are no switches inside the house. Moreover, in heavy industry, AI appears as a helpful assistant to help humanity. When merging with quantum computers and advanced technology methods, those pieces of machinery have a significant reduction in energy usage and an incredible data processing speed [2]. They are used for great purposes. For instance, forecasting the weather conditions by those computers can be done not only for a few days or a few weeks but also for years, which are totally useful for people to cope with natural disasters. Moreover, especially in medical fields, quantum computers can mimic the movements and the statuses of atoms [3] so that many scientists can do research and reach the final solution in a short amount of time.</p>
                  <h3>1.3 Ideas that can be launched in the near future</h3>
                  <p>Talking about the near future, there are many things that we can discuss. Firstly, the metaverse is the breakthrough that must be mentioned. Recently, Mark Zuckerberg - CEO of Facebook, announced to us about the development of a virtual world, where everyone can see their friends no matter distance. It is a leap not only in IT in general but also in business because of its convenience and optimization. Secondly, more and more crucial tasks can be done by machines such as firefighting and exploring space. When doing these jobs, we can only equip ourselves with limited knowledge and pieces of equipment, but robots are not the same, they can learn a trillion books in a week, cool down their systems near to the absolute zero, or even be capable of handling and transporting deadly liquids. [4]</p>
                  <h3>1.4 Tools and developments can actualize these evolutions</h3>
                  <p>In my point of view, the most crucial factor is humanity’s perspectives on AI and Machine Learning. If we have good intentions and carefulness, our products will be fruitful and do proper things. Otherwise, people with the aim of corrupted motives, their work can be a threat to society. This is particularly true when talking about Bob and Alice, both are AI robots, designed by Facebook AI Research. However, we have to put a stop to both of them because of their mysterious behaviors, which form their own language to communicate with each other. That is a lesson for everyone doing related fields, we should control our programs more strictly, limit the source or the method that can be a risk to our artifact.
	The technological aspect seems to be less nasty, the more research we fail, the more modern our technology will be. So, when it comes to technical issues related to high-risk jobs, which are mentioned above. One possible solution is to build a simulator combined with AI and Machine Learning. As mentioned above, firefighting, space exploring, and more require us to have practical experience. AI and Machine Learning can create potential simulators for those jobs so we will be able to use a simulator to train our ability.</p>
                  <h2>2. The Impact of AI and Machine Learning</h2>
                  <h3>2.1 Potential impacts that can be made</h3>
                  <p>Initially, during this Covid-19 pandemic, we all find it difficult to communicate with each other directly and faced disadvantages in many aspects such as learning, working and doing business. Thanks to AI and Machine Learning, these troubles seem to be solved. With technologies, we can do everything without face-to-face connection, which leads to the reduction of virus spreading. Secondly, as mentioned above, we can cut down huge amounts of working positions in dangerous jobs like firefighting, interactions with nuclear power, or exploring university leading to the reduction of the hidden risks ratio and lessening the number of fatal accidents during works. Moreover, machines are capable of absorbing data faster than humans so they will make jobs simpler.</p>
                  <h3>2.2 Changes that can happen in the future</h3>
                  <p>Expansions move together with varieties, and we cannot avoid them. In my opinion, the most changing aspect should be the way humans interact with machines. Especially in transportation, it may lose its current standing when the world is going to connect through a sci-fi world, meetings, excursions, are all going to be held online. We have no idea whether those are positive or negative changes, but we cannot deny that they bring significant changes to us. Besides, cybersecurity should also be mentioned. In recent years, organizations have always tried to overstep hackers in order to protect their data. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, the protections can be stronger than ever using face recognition or fingerprints. [5]</p>
                  <h3>2.3 Most affected people, and the change of AI can do with humanity</h3>
                  <p>The highly influenced people seem to be businesspeople. Imagine that instead of noting down each of your schedules and keeping track on your own every time, now we just have to use an AI assistant to help us address all the information and save bunches of time. Furthermore, people’s place in many fields such as manual workers can also be taken over by machines. On the good side, we can take advantage of robots’ power to make jobs painless. However, the division between the rich and the poor is likely to increase due to this.</p>
                  <h2>3. My Life when AI and Machine Learning appeared</h2>
                  <h3>3.1 AI and Machine Learning changed the way I lived and so did my relationships</h3>
                  <p>In my daily routine, AI and Machine Learning help me to have a better lifestyle. For example, I can control the nutritious meals that I eat, I do everything in time because I have an online reminder assistant and I am able to save more time because I have automatic gadgets such as vacuum cleaners or washing machines. To me, as a student of Information Technology, the most changed thing is the way I study. With today’s technology, it is not hard for me to find an AI teacher online such as Google AI, and then look for my lesson. Besides, rather than spending time looking for informative books at the bookstore, search engines with advanced AI can help me to quickly extract my findings, resulting in a better outcome. It not only saves a lot of time but also is extremely flexible so I can match it up with my learning schedule at school. About my surrounding relationships, I find that AI is actually helpful. My parents cannot go outside during this Covid-19 pandemic, and they are not familiar with using online shopping platforms, but they are still able to book foods and vegetables because of the AI voice assistant, this is rarely popular back to 10 or 15 years ago. My friends are mostly the same age as me so we do not have to worry about buying commodities but through advanced AI and Machine Learning technology, we can keep in touch with each other. For example, if we want to set up an offline meeting, everyone in my group can use Google Map to know the directions and is unable to get lost. Those are the clearest proofs of what AI and Machine Learning can affect our daily life until this moment. I hope that in the future, we can upgrade these technologies to a new level and form a beautiful hi-tech world, where AI can do most of the things and we just need to keep it under our supervision.</p>
