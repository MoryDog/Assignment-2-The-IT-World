                  <h2>1. Importance of Cybersecurity and Privacy in the modern world</h2>
                  <h3>1.1 The current state of Cybersecurity and Privacy technology</h3>
									<p>Cybersecurity-related topics are now making news across the media and a variety of settings, including businesses, online blogs, and social media platforms, causing many scandals, and reminding the world of the importance of information security. Examples can be seen in 2018 when it was revealed that the data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica unlawfully harvested data from tens of millions of Facebook users for ad targeting during the 2016 United States presidential election [6] or in June of 2021 when the professional networking service LinkedIn reported that data including personal information of nearly 700 million of its users were stolen by a hacker and posted on a dark web forum [7]. As time goes by, people, networks, and governments all across the globe has become more and more reliant on the Internet and social media platforms for their day-to-day activities, thanks to the Internet's global connectivity and its presence in everything we do from communication, business, education to entertainment. Due to that, cybersecurity has become increasingly important in the operations of businesses and people when using the web in order to deal with the increasing threats from the cyber world. Cybersecurity, as an inherent component of computer science, is the use of techniques and procedures to safeguard computer systems, networks, internet-connected devices, and software against cyberthreats such as ransomware, malware, phishing, denial-of-service attacks, and more methods, preventing them from accessing databases and important systems for malicious purposes [8]. Some of the most recent cybersecurity technologies are the implementation of AI and Machine Learning to analyze large amounts of data and using behavioral analytics to aid in the detection of potential and real-time cyber threats by identifying unusual patterns in a system's and network's actions [9]. Blockchain cybersecurity, which operates on the peer-to-peer network basics of blockchain technology and verifies user activity while employing encryption to safeguard the user's data from illegal access, is another technology that is also getting traction and recognition from IT professionals. [9].</p>
                  <h3>1.2 Capabilities of today's infomation security methods</h3>
                  <p>Current security methods range from simple passwords, firewalls, backing up data and antivirus software to more advanced systems such as biometric recognition, which identifies a person based on their biological and behavioral characteristics such as a fingerprint, iris, retina, hand shape, voice, and signature [8] along with enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) that would combine biometrics, text messages, emails and time-limited security codes for verification as a second layer of protection [10]. In addition, another important aspect of today’s cybersecurity is the implementation of information security protocols and policies together with the training of personnel to raise awareness about cybersecurity and reduce human error in incidents. Education of users and employees of basic information security principles such as safe surfing, identifying and dealing with cyber threats, securing, and backing up data along with risk management [11] is widely carried out by businesses and organizations around the world today as an integral part of their policies in order to maintain information security and protect their user’s data and operations from cyberattacks.</p>
                  <h3>1.3 Future technologies that can be adapted in the upcoming years</h3>
                  <p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution, often known as Industry 4.0, has resulted in increased interconnectedness and automation across the world. In the industrial sector, traditional production processes and old technologies are steadily being replaced by newer technologies such as smart gadgets, automated machines and more advanced computer systems which have helped improve the effectiveness and productivity of production in factories [12]. As more sectors and businesses are becoming “smart” and digitally connected through the Internet of Things (IoT), they also make themselves more susceptible to cyberthreats due to the lack of security in computer systems and devices along with the large shortages of skilled people in cybersecurity [12]. To deal with this worsening cybersecurity landscape, many technologies have been considered to be crucial in the upcoming fight against these looming threats. Cloud computing, which is a technology that has been around since the 2000s will prove to be important in defeating ransomware and malware as the cloud can employ big data and rapid analytics to preemptively identify and handle threats that attempt to overwhelm and bypass security to attack users [13]. In addition, automated technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) will continue to play a vital role in tackling Industry 4.0 problems in the future since the amount of internet-connected systems and digital devices are increasing to a point that traditional security methods cannot protect them all. This is where AI comes into play as it can process an enormous amount of data along with constantly monitoring online traffic and data for any hidden threats that would normally be too overwhelming for a human professional to handle [14]. Furthermore, by using algorithms to analyze user behavior and activities, detect unusual patterns, and dynamically handle cyber threats that are constantly changing, predictive algorithms and machine learning techniques will assist organizations in identifying and fixing vulnerabilities in their systems early to prevent data loss and disruption of the supply chain [15]. </p>
                  <h2>2. In what ways can these technologies affect us?</h2>
                  <h3>2.1 The main impacts of Cybersecurity and Privacy</h3>
                  <p>The Internet of Things is becoming increasingly important in both industries and our everyday lives. It’s present in every facet of human life from communication to business, education, healthcare, and government with the amount of IoT devices recorded growing every year. As a result, the amount of data that is generated and needs to be processed has also exponentially increased along with the frequency of cyberattacks. As cybersecurity plays a vital role in protecting the data of governments, organizations, military and socially critical infrastructure like finance and healthcare, we will see it being the focal point of future development. The adaptation of  AI and Machine Learning will help businesses and industries automate data analysis, classify, filter, and handle large data chunks more efficiently than ever before. However, their implementation would also create new risks as those systems themselves may become under attack by hackers through corruption and also be used to create smart malware that is capable of bypassing security software. This in turn will drive businesses and organizations to facilitate the training of cybersecurity skills and education of information security in people to produce qualified IT professionals that would fill in the current shortage of skilled workers around the world.</p>
                  <h3>2.2 The effects of Cybersecurity on society and people's privacy</h3>
                  <p>Ever since people first discovered how to hack computer systems and networks, there has been an ongoing battle between cybersecurity professionals and cyberthreats. Development in IT technologies will undoubtedly help both sides to expand and find new strategies to outperform the other in the coming years [16]. The threat landscape will see major changes as hackers would also take advantage of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning along with new advanced tools and software to develop more sophisticated, dangerous malware that will be capable of corrupting automated systems and infiltrating the internal systems of organizations, stealing data, and disrupting critical operations. Ultimately, the ones that would be affected the most from this will be normal people like us who use the Internet in our daily lives as cyber attacks would cause major disruption to social infrastructures that we rely on like healthcare, power supply, education, communication, and transportation. Examples of this would be when there’s an emergency call and the hospital is unable to respond to the call due to their communication line being interrupted by hackers or even worse, endangering the lives of patients whose life support systems are turned off due to power outages from these attacks. Lastly, future developments in technologies would also see legacy machinery and old computer systems be eventually phased out as well as automation being more common in industries, reducing the number of cybersecurity professionals in some areas as future AI-based systems can help predict threats and handle complex situations more efficiently and less prone to errors.</p>
                  <h2>3. How this will affect me on a personal level</h2>
                  <h3>3.1 Cybersecurity and Privacy has taught me new things and changed the way I am living as well as other people such as my family, friends,… </h3>
                  <p>Advances in cybersecurity technologies will have a wide range of consequences for everyone, including myself. As new security methods emerge, I'll have to update my computer to stay up to date with the most recent antivirus software or security measures since hackers will eventually develop new malware and tools that are capable of bypassing and defeating current information security technologies. In addition, I would have to do checks more often on my current email and social media accounts in order to update their passwords as not changing your password for a long time will put your devices at risk of being attacked by cybercriminals. Furthermore, these threats will also remind me to be more careful when surfing the web and using social media platforms since malicious links and fake websites can now disguise themselves so they can steal your personal information without you even realizing it if you accidentally clicked on them. Furthermore, my parents would be needing my assistance because they were born before computers were invented and thus have little experience with the Internet and cybersecurity in general. As a result, it would be my responsibility to instruct them on safe web browsing behaviors and how to create strong passwords to protect my parents from cyber threats that seek to harm them on the Internet.</p>
