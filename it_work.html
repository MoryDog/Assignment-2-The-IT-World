                “Yes, sure. Nice to meet you all. My name is Mai Thao and I used to be study in RMIT Viet Nam as well. I was a Bachelor
                of Information Technology in RMIT Viet Nam. After I finished my bachelor, I worked for a Singaporean company for about
                two years. Then I came to Norway to finish my master’s degree in Applied Computer Science. Now, I am a software engineer
                in Air Things in Oslo, Norway.”

            <p class="answer">
              “So as a software engineer in Air Things, I did the mostly building software from building infrastructure on Amazon we
              service to develop features in our web dashboard, like for example establishing a new API for our partners, or making a
              new feature available on our dashboard for our clients to use. And apart from them I also communicate with the product
              team so they can be updated to the process, the current process of our product so that they can give the customer the
              best update they have.”

            <p class="answer">
              “I don’t really talk with investors or customers or partners. That’s the job of the product people or our CEO, or
              operations people who ship the products to the client. My job is to mostly communicate with the product people to update
              the progress of the current features that are rolling out. And apart from that, we also work with the firmware team and
              the hardware team because we are an air monitoring and we produce air monitor devices, so the hardware and firmware team
              are the people who produce the device, and then we need to provide them an interface that is accessible by the client.
              So, what I did is also communicating with them so that we can have the best integration between hardware, firmware and
              our software solutions.”

            <h2>4. What are your interactions with other IT professionals?</h2>
            <p class="answer">
              “Mostly bugs and testing, obviously. So, the process of working in our team is that – are you guys familiar with the
              Jira board, or any kind of project management tool, for example Trello or...? [Our team answers the question] Yeah. So
              basically, it’s like a board and then it has different columns on it, and then they have like a backlog to do something
              in progress and then the “Done” column, right? So, each of us will be assigned a task there, and then when you started
              to work on it, you move it to “In progress”, and then when you’re done, you move it into “In review” or something like
              that. And when it’s in review, you start to talk to your colleagues to get them to review your work basically, and then
              we talk about the work like how it can be improved or is there any risks that I haven’t seen in the work that my
              colleagues are able to spot out. So mostly about that, and then we have a retro once a month for all the people in the
              team, and we talk about how it was during the month, like what went well, what didn’t go well and how can we improve on
              the thing that did not go very well. So mostly those kinds of things, and sometimes we hang out and have beers as well,
              but that’s not really probably a day-to-day job, just once in a while.”

            <p class="answer">
                “So, we’re in a weird time where COVID is happening and stuff but now, the situation is improved a lot in Norway, so
                we’re trying to get back into the office as much as possible. But before, we used to just work from home and then just
                join meetings whenever people need. If you ask about the last few months up until now, we’re getting back into the
                office.”

            <h2>6. What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h2>
            <p class="answer">
                “The most challenging aspect is probably planning and delegating a new feature that’s coming out. Because when we talked
                about a new feature, we don’t know what is inside of it. So, the first part is always having to talk to other
                businesses. For example, who have already implemented the feature ahead of us to see how they used it in their company
                and compared to the way that we want to use it and then work it out from there. But then, there is a lot of way to
                implement something right and their way is not always like the way we have to go. So, we have to look at their solutions
                and see how we can apply it properly to our system. It takes a lot of trials and errors, and a lot of meeting as well
                with colleagues and the people in the team. It also involves a lot of people from product to design, to hardware,
                firmware but the most challenging part is the most fun part as well, so it is very fun to do those kinds of things and
                it is very excited when we are able to finally ship it out.”

          <!-- 7.  -->
          <div class="qa-container">
            <h2>7. What elements are necessary for a successful project and why?</h2>
            <p class="answer">
                “I mean, obviously the deadlines, being on time for the deadline is one of the most important aspects. Besides that, you
                also have to constantly update the client so that they know what we’re doing and what challenges we are facing as well.
                Having the communication between us and the clients also make the client happy because they feel like they were kept in
                a loop and then they know what we’re doing and not just like sitting and doing nothing all day. So, communicating,
                especially trying to estimate the project, try to make it on time at least. So, what we usually do is just estimate it
                if we’re thinking that we’re able to make this within a month, for example, and we give some extra time when we tell the
                client. For example, we will tell the client that we need two month or two and a half months to do this because after
                that first month, we also need to test out the feature and make sure everything goes, works as expected before we ship
                it to them. So, it is very important to, uhm… . So, the three most important parts are: first, be on deadlines, keep the
                clients updated, in a loop, and then test out your feature to make sure they work properly before shipping it to the
                client.”

            <h2>8. What have you learned from mistakes in a technical job?</h2>
            <p class="answer">
                “I learned that; you cannot really work by yourself. Especially when you started to join the company like when you are
                studying, the project scope is always kind of small so you can always manage to do it by yourself. But when you started
                to join a company, you cannot do everything by yourself, then you started to have to reach out and ask for help. The
                thing that I learned is that not to be afraid to ask for help. So, when you are unclear about something, you shouldn’t
                ask at first, you should start to look for the answer at least and try to figure it out by yourself, try to understand
                the problem before you ask the questions. Otherwise, it is going to be like a very stupid question that you are going to
                ask your colleagues and then you are just going to waste your colleague time. But it is important to know when to stop
                looking and start to ask the questions because when you look hard enough and you still couldn’t find the answer, it is
                time for you to ask the question and you shouldn’t be afraid to ask.”

            <h2>9. Can you give some advice for young students that are learning in the IT field?</h2>
            <p class="answer">
                “The advice is to… . Are you guys all in your first year? [ Our team answers the question ], so I guess now for you
                guys, it is just get used to the knowledge, all of the knowledge. Depends on what you guys are interested in . At least
                try to get a very firm foundation. And then I guess, in your second year, you can start looking for internships or
                something like that. Because that is the school program I think if I remember correctly. I think it is very important
                for you to get some industry experience before you graduate as well. Because what you are studying in school is good but
                it most all of them is not going to be applicable when you start to work. So, it is important to go and see what it is
                like in a professional environment then you can prepare yourself when you graduate but maybe that is not at this moment,
                maybe in a year or so.”
