                  <h2>1. What are Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</h2>
                  <h3>1.1 The rise of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies in recent years</h3>
									<p>In the era where human continuously makes incredible leaps, more and more technologies, smart applications have been developed for the needs of society. A part of them, Blockchain, can be considered the “core” of future information technology platforms.
So what is Blockchain? Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger, or more simply, a database in a network. The ledger is distributed among network participants. Since duplicate copies of the same ledger version are recorded at many different locations, this demonstrates that across the entire system, a document may function as a unique authority. According to MIT Sloan assistant professor Christian Catalini, “At a high level, blockchain technology allows a network of computers to agree at regular intervals on the true state of a distributed ledger. Such ledgers can contain different types of shared data, such as transaction records, attributes of transactions, credentials, or other pieces of information. The ledger is often secured through a clever mix of cryptography and game theory, and does not require trusted nodes like traditional networks." This is what enables bitcoin to transfer value throughout the world without the use of traditional intermediaries like banks.
With many of its characteristics, Blockchain will open up a potential application trend for multiple fields such as banking, retail, transportation, manufacturing, telecommunications, etc. Cryptocurrency, one of the forms of technology built up based on Blockchain, has become a global phenomenon in recent years, especially Bitcoin shaking the world with multiple times hitting unbelievable prices. This technology holds great potential in solving numerous economic challenges that the current and future society might face, as well as getting rid of third-party appearance during transparency.
</p>
                  <h3>1.2 Contribution of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency to society</h3>
                  <p>As said before, Blockchain has many applications in the present day. With its capacity to increase openness and fairness while also saving businesses time and money, the technology is having an influence on a wide range of areas, from contract enforcement to making government run more efficiently. Some of the real-world applications of Blockchain can be easily found such as IoT operating system – creating an ideal environment for data transmission with highly secure peer-to-peer self-governing networks, NFT marketplaces, Anti-money laundering tracking system, which uses “blocks” to store records of full transaction chains, and can be used to compare to the records of other “blocks” to find irregularities, and so on. As for cryptocurrency, its market can be considered a potential form of market for future trading platforms thanks to Blockchain technology. Some benefits can be listed out such as decentralization, which means these markets are not issued by or going through a central authority, or the efficiency of the transfers in cryptocurrency markets, including cheaper transaction cost and faster duration.</p>
                  <h3>1.3 The near future of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies technology</h3>
                  <p>It can be agreed that somewhere shortly, Blockchain will revolutionize the world in ways we can’t imagine. With technology evolving every day, many possibilities can be done in no time. Based on Blockchain, Cryptocurrency and its characteristic in the trade markets promise a potential future, providing applications such as transactions in the future can be more effective, including higher speed, processes regardless of space and time, impressive security with hackers mostly unable to interrupt the transactions thanks to the secured and decentralization nature of the Blockchain technology. Another example of the use of this technology, digital identity, will gradually replace passwords and authentication questions for proof of who we are on the Internet. The digital identity could be seen as a random unique set of numbers assigned to each user on a Blockchain network. Not only this would be safer, easier to manage, but your identity also will not be hacked or changed without your private key. Another thing that can take advantage of Blockchain technology is health records. Hospitals and healthcare centers can use it to transmit information to each other. This would decrease redundancy and speed up diagnostics while maintaining patient privacy at all times.</p>
                  <h2>2. Ways that Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies can change the world</h2>
                  <h3>2.1 The market flow has been fluctuated because of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies. Leading to many other consequences.</h3>
                  <p>Anti-money laundering (AML) has always been a pressing problem for many governments of countries around the world. Numerous solutions were offered but those had yet to put an end to the vice. However, Blockchain technology has important properties that have the ability to prevent money laundering. Every transaction on the blockchain produces a permanent trail of data that cannot be changed. As a result, authorities can more easily track down the original source of the money. A public blockchain ledger can monitor, validate, and record the whole history of each transaction. This means if any phases in the transaction are left unverified, the transaction will be immediately blocked. Not only AML but many other Blockchain-based technologies will bring massive influences to the world in a near future. Such as cryptocurrency, which offers several benefits to enterprises all around the world. It has made it easier for businesses to expand into worldwide markets rather than limiting themselves to domestic markets. This has allowed vendors to build connections and trust with markets that were previously unavailable, which has been excellent for developing countries.</p>
                  <h3>2.2 Many industries and people are involved in Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</h3>
                  <p>Multiple industries have been and will be soon evolving with Blockchain. However, what comes with the revolution is the disruption to many industries and the unemployment of innumerable workers from different jobs. As mentioned above, Blockchain abilities include cutting off intermediation sectors in transactions. In other words, middlemen will most likely be made redundant. Additionally, Blockchain is capable of providing a comprehensive and verifiable history of a transactional ledger, which could simplify and quicken the auditing process. Since the work has been reduced, companies will hire fewer accountants to save money, which then puts these employees into underemployment.</p>
                  <h2>3. Their impact on my life and the people around me</h2>
                  <h3>3.1	As I am a teenager, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies is something helpful for studying. As other adults, this is like a new method to control their finace.</h3>
                  <p>Blockchain technology has been developing for a while and it will keep on so in the future. With the help of it, many people’s daily life, including mine, will change a lot compared to the past. For instance, gradually paper certificates or identity cards will not be necessary for me anymore since everything is encrypted and saved on the blockchain, and I’m in full control of them to give out accessibility to whoever I want. Another mentioned ability of Blockchain that would seem to benefit me is cutting off the middleman in my transactions. I can just order meals directly from restaurants or communicate straight forward to a driver for a ride around, and none of these need to go through any third parties or central authorities, which could save me quite an amount of money from intermediary fees. In addition, I particularly feel that Cryptocurrency would make the present society a better place, due to the ability of blockchain technology. A good example for the subject is that not only me, but many other relatives like my mom and my uncle are also skeptical of banks and financial organizations, yet keeping all of their money isn't a good option as they want to use it to invest on some other industries. Any signal of an economic downturn would create significant worry and concern about the cash they have saved. Cryptocurrency, on the other hand, allows transferring money away from banks and back into the hands of the people in a more controllable way. It does not strict to the rules that banks and other financial organizations apply. In my opinion,  it's always a positive thing when I can get control over my own money. The real-life applications of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency don’t just stop at examples that I gave out, and they will continue to go further, till the point where Blockchain is used to almost anything in our life.</p>
