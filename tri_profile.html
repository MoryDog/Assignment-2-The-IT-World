                    <p>My name is Nguyen Ngoc Duc Tri. You can find me with my student ID: s3926650 or my email address: s3926650@rmit.edu.vn. I was born in Ho Chi Minh City on September 17th, 2003, which means I’m 18 years old now. I’ve been learning English
                        non-stop for the past 12 academic years and recently, I’m studying Chinese to expand my language skills, as well as getting to know more about the Chinese culture. I think I’m the kind of person that is always motivated to dig
                        deeper into things that are new to me, or what I love to do, such as coding, technology, which has then led me to the world of IT. I enjoy playing sports like badminton and ping pong, yet due to my eye issues, I’m not allowed to
                        play sports anymore, which frustrated me a lot. I love playing video games, however, I’m also very interested in how the games are made since the first time I played them, which aroused my dream of becoming a Game Developer. When
                        I first played video games, I realized that not only did I want to play them, but I would like to make a game of my own too. Therefore, I started to research how a game is made. There are many elements, but one of them had sparked
                        up my interest in IT: Coding and programming languages like C++, Javascript, C#, etc. Until now, I’ve learned through the basics of Pascal, C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python. In addition to the valuable lectures and tutorials
                        throughout the courses, I expect to improve and gain more experience in teamwork, programming logic, knowledge in IT, as well as making new friends, seeking chances to interact with professional IT experts and learn as much as
                        I could from them. </p>

        <!-- My thoughts -->
        <h2>My thoughs about the test results</h2>
        <p class="description-content">
            For me, the results of these tests reflect my personality, and my attitude when dealing with certain situations. However, not everything in these test results is correct about me. For example, I actually think a lot before doing something rather than
            just doing it emotionally. Therefore, I don’t see them as my actual person. On the other hand, some factors truly show what I am right now, and I appreciated having recognized them. As can be seen from the result, I’m an introverted person,
            and for me, this is not good at all when forming a team. Since I feel uncomfortable communicating with other teammates, it would be annoying and reduce the whole team’s productivity and outcomes in some worse scenarios. I’ll carefully take
            a look at myself again, and then try my best to improve, especially my communication and group-working skills.
