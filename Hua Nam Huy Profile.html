									<p>My name is Hua Nam Huy. My student ID and email are s3881103 and s3881103@rmit.edu.vn.
                     I come from Ho Chi Minh City – the largest city in Vietnam, and I’ve been studying Software Engineering at RMIT University on Saigon South Campus for 3 semesters.
                      Playing video games with my pals, watching YouTube, and reading light novels are some of the things I enjoy doing in my spare time and recently I’ve been learning coding from online websites too.
                      When I was young,  My brother and I would often ask my grandpa for his permission to play some simple games on his work computer.
                      In those days, the fun from playing games motivated me to become a video game developer when I grow up as I dreamt of playing a game that I created myself, but the advent of the Internet and social media altered everything.
                       Following that, I learned that the field of information technology encompassed more than just games, and I developed an interest in learning more about IT and its applications in our world.
                        I was curious as to how IT technicians and programmers made it so that whatever information you want to know is available at the click of a button, or how they managed to create a video game with moving characters and sound.
                         This inspired my decision to become a software engineer and discover how the world of IT works through the use of lines of code.
                          I've only had a little experience with programming languages like Python and C/C++ up until now, and as I finish my first year at RMIT University, I intend to enroll in additional courses to get more programming knowledge and expertise.
                           I'd like to learn more about the Java and Python programming languages to help with my coding studies, as well as become acquainted with key software engineering ideas, patterns, and tools that would be required for my future career..</p>

          <h2>My thought about the results</h2>
          <p class="description-content">
            The results from the three tests above provided a very interesting view of my personality and preferences that even I am
            not aware of. they give accurate suggestions for me to make better decisions career-wise Moreover, I get to know my
            strengths and weaknesses better so that I can plan my studies accordingly to maximize my strengths and improve my
            weaknesses. Given the results that I received, I know what kinds of behavior and action can be beneficial to the team,
            in terms of increasing efficiency, performance. But I would say that it will not greatly influence my behavior because I
            will likely be true to myself and express my truest self to others.
