              Though this is my first semester at RMIT University, the last 9 weeks were extremely great and useful to me. I joined a group since Week 5 and then we started to work on this assignment. At first, I felt a little bit of shy because this is the first time that I’ve done this in university. However, the friendliness of everyone is overwhelming me and I feel comfortable while doing tasks with everyone. Started with Huy, he was the first person who I met. As a semester-3 student, he is full of confidence and knowledge, so that he helped me, and the others, a lot through giving advices. When it comes to Duy, even though we cannot meet him directly because of some reasons, he is very active in our meetings and contribute a lot of valueable information for our assignment. Tri, the last teammate in our group, sometimes, he got some trouble so that he could not say much in our meeting but he was extremely responsible for all of his tasks. He is also a very friendly and have a wide range of knowledge. In my opinion, I feel that though I do not perform my task flawlessly, I have learned countless things during the work and I appreciate it. Lastly, everyone in my group is very responsible for their work. We all complete our devided tasks in time with great perfomances on a quite same amount of tasks for each other. The other three has left inside me a remarkable memory and I hope that we can meet again as a teammates in later courses.

              Over the course of the last few weeks that I’ve been working with my teammates, I can say that everyone so far has been very hardworking and responsible towards the group’s projects. Although I have worked with many teams before due to the requirements of previous courses, I find it to be a new experience everytime I group up with new students since you’re basically working with people that you don’t know a lot about. In order for the team to work effectively, we often held meetings and also divided the assignment sections into smaller parts with each person in charge of a particular part so we can better manage time and keep track of the deadline. Quan – our team coordinator is resposible for organizing all of our meetings and even arranged the interview with an IT expert, he is a resourceful, responsible guy who always finished his tasks before the deadlines. While I didn’t talk much with Tri during meetings, he was a friendly and professionial person as his work was always detailed and carefully researched and he always try to catch up on what he missed. Duy didn’t show up to a lot of meetings because he has his own reasons but we have worked together on designing the website for our group report and I can say that he has been very skillful and was very active in finding and reporting on important information for contributing to our project idea. For myself, I think I’ve done well at managing the team’s progress and finding referencing materials for our team along with trying to code a website using my limited experience in web design. Overall, my teammates have all gave their best when doing the assignments, they were all communicative, responsible and I was very comfortable when working with everyone in the team.

                After the weeks spent working with this team, one thing I can say is that I am highly satisfied with the results that we
                have achieved so far together. I am working with completely new members that I do not have any prior working experiences
                with. Despite that, the team showed adequate communication skills which led to the fact that we can exchange ideas,
                strengths and weaknesses in a very timely and efficient manner. Our team rarely misses any deadlines that we laid out
                for each part of the assignment. Regarding my teammates, I highly think that all Huy, Quan, and Tri are very competent
                and professional. They all showed their significant levels of contribution and efforts towards the assignment.
                Personally, I think that I also had performed well during the timespan of this assignment. Like all of my teammates, I
                took part in documenting the report and researched relavant materials for the assignment.
